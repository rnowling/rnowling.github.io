Email: nowling@msoe.edu<br />[CV](/static/rnowling_resume.pdf)

I've been an Associate Professor in the Electrical Engineering & Computer Science department of the [Milwaukee School of Engineering](https://www.msoe.edu) since August 2018.  From 2014 to 2018, I worked on scalable machine learning systems at [AdRoll](http://www.adroll.com/) and [Red Hat](http://www.redhat.com/). Before then, I received a Ph.D. in [Computer Science & Engineering](http://cse.nd.edu/) from the [University of Notre Dame](http://www.nd.edu) and a B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics from [Eckerd College](http://www.eckerd.edu).  My research over the last few years has employed statistics and machine learning to study the genomic data from insect vectors.

Joshua worked on software development tasks related to the ringling-cli and ringling model registry projects.

### Krystal M. (Spring 2019 - Spring 2020)
Krystal evaluated methods for detecting chromsomal inversions from SNPs and then implemented and ran a variant calling pipeline.
Krystal graduated with a B.S. in BioMolecular Engineering in Spring 2019. Krystal then started a  M.S. in Bioinformatics at
Marquette University in Fall 2019.

### Matt A. (Summer 2019, Fall 2020 - Spring 2021)
Matt implemented a population genetics simulator and explored how different processes of molecular evolution present in 
PCA of SNP data.  Matt then evaluated clustering algorithms in terms of their accuracy for identifying population
clusters.  Matt graduated from MSOE in Spring 2022.

### Oliver B. (Winter 2018 - Spring 2019)
Oliver was an exchange student from the [Czech Technical University in Prague](https://www.cvut.cz/en) studying at MSOE for the 2018-2019 school year.  Oliver was working on applying convolutional neural networks to detecting prostates in Magnetic Resonance (MR) images.
