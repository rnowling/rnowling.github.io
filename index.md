Welcome to my web site.  My name is RJ Nowling.  I'm an assistant professor of computer science and coordinator of the [Graduate Certificate in Machine Learning](https://www.msoe.edu/academics/certificates/machine-learning-graduate-certificate/) at the [Milwaukee School of Engineering](https://www.msoe.edu).  MSOE is a primarily-undergraduate polytechnic offering students a challenging academic environment with small classes that emphasizes hands-on learning.  Our CS program emphasizes data science and machine learning as critical skills for all graduates.

My research applies machine learning and statistics to genomic data.  Insects present multiple challenges in sequencing, assembly, and analysis that require the development of new tools and approaches.  I collaborate with groups at larger research universities and undergraduate students at my institution.  I aim to provide students with experiences through which they can assess research as a potential career path.  Through my collaborations, students are exposed to fields outside of computer science, the nature of interdisciplinary work, and research-intensive environments.
