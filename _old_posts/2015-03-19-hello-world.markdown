On the suggestion of a [colleague](http://web.willbenton.com/), I decided to create a blog.  I'm currently a software engineer in Emerging Technlogies at [Red Hat,  Inc.](http://www.redhat.com/) where I focus on software, infrastructure, and consulting for data science.

I'm also finishing my Ph.D. in [Computer Science & Engineering](http://cse.nd.edu/) at the [University of Notre Dame](http://www.nd.edu) part-time.  I've been involved in computational physics and bioinformatics projects spanning the creation and evaluation of new mathematical models and methods, software engineering for information storage and processing, and analysis of physical and biological systems.

The transition from life as a Ph.D. student to working at Red Hat has been a rewarding experience, allowing me to reflect on ways to facilitate information exchange between the two sectors. With this in mind, my goals are to document and share my experiences and ideas through posts that are a mix of practical walk throughs, philosophical musings and reflections, and write ups on theoretical topics.
