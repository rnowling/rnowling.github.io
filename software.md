My lab develops software tools for use in developing and distributing our methods.  Our goals including releasing all of our software under a liberal open-source license such as the [Apache License, v2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), easy to use, and accompanied by documentation.

## Asaph
Asaph is a software package for detecting, localizing, and genotyping large polymorphic inversions from SNP data.

## PeakMatcher
PeakMatcher is a simple tool we developed to match peaks from DNA enrichment assays across genome assemblies to aid in validation.  As genome assemblies are improved through new sequencing methods, DNA enrichment assay data need to be re-analyzed using the new assemblies.  PeakMatcher provides scripts for comparing called peaks on the same genome (e.g., to validate pipeline parameters or compare agreement across different assays) or different genomes using the raw reads (e.g., to validate that peaks are not lost with the new genome assembly or identify new peaks for analysis).
