I'm an Assistant Professor in the Electrical Engineering & Computer Science department of the [Milwaukee School of Engineering](https://www.msoe.edu).

I received a B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics from [Eckerd College](http://www.eckerd.edu) and a Ph.D. in [Computer Science & Engineering](http://cse.nd.edu/) from the [University of Notre Dame](http://www.nd.edu).

From 2014 to 2018, I worked on scalable machine learning systems in industry.  Most recently, I was a data science engineer at [AdRoll](http://www.adroll.com/); my team was responsible for building and maintaining all aspects (from models to infrastructure) of a recommendation system used for online advertising. Before AdRoll, I was a software engineer at [Red Hat, Inc.](http://www.redhat.com/) where I focused on software, infrastructure, and consulting for distributed systems and data science.

For the 2017--2018 academic year, I was also an adjunct instructor in the [Math, Stats, and Computer Science](http://www.marquette.edu/mscs/) department at [Marquette University](http://www.marquette.edu/).  I tought courses related to data science in the M.S. in Computing program.  My passion for education has also led me to serve as a co-organizer of the [Big Data WI](https://bigdatawisconsin.org/) conference since 2016.

In addition to my industry role and teaching, I've continued to be actively involved in research in the fields of bioinformatics and computational chemistry.  Most recently, my focus has been using statistics and machine learning to develop new methods for population genetics analyses of insects vectors.

I spend my free time road cycling and at the dog park with my two dogs.
