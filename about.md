RJ Nowling is a machine learning engineer, adjunct instructor, and researcher residing in Milwaukee, WI.

I received a B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics from [Eckerd College](http://www.eckerd.edu) and a Ph.D. in [Computer Science & Engineering](http://cse.nd.edu/) from the [University of Notre Dame](http://www.nd.edu).

Since 2014, I've been working in industry on scalable machine learning systems.  I'm currently a data science engineer at [AdRoll](http://www.adroll.com/); my team is responsible for building and maintaining all aspects (from models to infrastructure) of a recommendation system used for online advertising. Previously, I was a software engineer at [Red Hat, Inc.](http://www.redhat.com/) where I focused on software, infrastructure, and consulting for distributed systems and data science.

Since Fall 2017, I've also been an adjunct instructor in the [Math, Stats, and Computer Science](http://www.marquette.edu/mscs/) department at [Marquette University](http://www.marquette.edu/).  I teach courses related to data science in the M.S. in Computing program.  My passion for education has also led me to serve as a co-organizer of the [Big Data WI](https://bigdatawisconsin.org/) conference since 2016.

In addition to my industry role and teaching, I'm still actively involved in research in the fields of bioinformatics and computational chemistry.  Most recently, my focus has been using statistics and machine learning to develop new methods for population genetics analyses of insects vectors.

I spend my free time road cycling and at the dog park with my two dogs.
