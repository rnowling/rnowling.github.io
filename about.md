I'm a data science engineer at [AdRoll](http://www.adroll.com/). Previously, I was a software engineer at [Red Hat, Inc.](http://www.redhat.com/) where I focused on software, infrastructure, and consulting for distributed systems and data science.

I have a Ph.D. in [Computer Science & Engineering](http://cse.nd.edu/) from the [University of Notre Dame](http://www.nd.edu) part-time.  I've been involved in computational physics and bioinformatics projects spanning the creation and evaluation of new mathematical models and methods, software engineering for information storage and processing, and analysis of simulations of physical and biological systems.

I live in Milwaukee, WI with my wife Marissa, our dogs Abby and Lyndsey, and our cat, Slice. In my free time, I enjoying reading ancient history and literature, hiking with my dogs, and road cycling.
