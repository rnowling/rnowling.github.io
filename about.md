I'm a software engineer in Emerging Technlogies at [Red Hat, Inc.](http://www.redhat.com/) where I focus on software, infrastructure, and consulting for distributed systems and data science.

I'm also finishing my Ph.D. in [Computer Science & Engineering](http://cse.nd.edu/) at the [University of Notre Dame](http://www.nd.edu) part-time.  I've been involved in computational physics and bioinformatics projects spanning the creation and evaluation of new mathematical models and methods, software engineering for information storage and processing, and analysis of physical and biological systems.
