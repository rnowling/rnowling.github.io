My research is focused on the application of machine learning and statistics to genomic data from insect vectors.  Insects present multiple challenges in sequencing, assembly, and analysis that require the development of new tools and approaches.  I collaborate with groups at larger research universities and undergraduate students at my institution.  I aim to provide students with experiences through which they can assess research as a potential career path.  Through my collaborations, students are exposed to fields outside of Computer Science, the nature of interdisciplinary work, and research-intensive environments.  You can learn more about my research at the [Nowling Lab](https://nowling-lab.github.io/) web site.
