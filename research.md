My main area of research is developing statistical and machine learning methods for the study of insects, particularly vectors of disease.  Through their saliva, mosquitoes such as *[Anopheles gambiae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anopheles_gambiae)* and other flies transmit the parasites that causes diseases such as [malaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria). Disease such as malaria, [dengue fever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dengue_fever), and [Zika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zika_fever) are major threats to public health; by studying these insects, we aim to understand mechanisms of immunity and insecticide resistance to aid in the fight to eradicate these diseases.  My primary focus is population genetics, or the study of how the genomes of these insects evolve and change in response to changing environmental conditions.

Detecting Chromosomal Inversions
================================
Chromosomal inversions an important role in ecological adaptation by enabling the accumulation of beneficial alleles (Love, et. al. 2016; Fuller, et al. 2017) and reproductive isolation (Noor, et a. 2001). The 2La inversion in the Anopheles gambiae complex has been associated with thermal tolerance of larvae (Rocca, et al. 2009), enhanced desiccation resistance in adult mosquitoes (Gray, et al. 2009), and susceptibility to malaria (Riehle, et al. 2017). Additionally, inversions must be identified and accounted for to avoid bias in population inference and association testing (Seich al Basatena, et al. 2013).

We are working on methods for detecting inversions from population genomics data.  Methods commonly used in humans rely on aligning reads to a reference genome.  Such methods, even when using long reads, are not as effective in insect genomes.  Such genomes are often full of problematic repetitive elements and their assemblies may be fragmented.  We have found that PCA-based methods can be quite effective for insects.  Our eventual goal is to be able to detect inversions even when the reference genome is highly fragmented.

Likelihood-Ratio Tests Adjusted for Missing Data
================================================
Single-SNP association tests are a popular and powerful statistical technique for identifying genomic variants that are associated with in population structure.  Recently, I proposed an adjusted likelihood-ratio test that handles unknown variants by using an uninformative (uniform) prior over all possible genotypes.  I demonstrated that this approach significantly reduces false positives when compared with more commonly-used techniques such as $$F_{ST}$$ and can uncover variation missed by other methods.

Transmembrane Receptors
=======================
Transmembrance receptors are proteins that sit in the membrane of the cell and are often activated or deactivated by the binding of a ligand to the extracellular side.  Examples of these receptors include [G Protein-coupled Receptors (GPCRs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_proteinâ€“coupled_receptor) which transfer signals by releasing [G Proteins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_protein) inside the cell and [Ligand-gated ion channels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand-gated_ion_channel) that act as valves for the transfer of ions like potassium and chloride into the cell. GPCRs are a common target of drugs including [selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_serotonin_reuptake_inhibitor) (SSRIs, antidepression medication) and [beta blockers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_blocker) (hypertension).

As part of a project to develop novel insecticides, I worked on developing a classifier for GPCR protein sequences to aid in identifying and annotating GPCRs in insect genomes.  I adapted several classifiers that had been trained primarily on GPCRs from humans and other model organisms using an ensemble-approach.

Biomedical Image Segmentation
=============================
Outside of my work in bioinformatics, I recently started collaborating with researchers at the [Medical College of Wisconsin](https://www.mcw.edu/) on applications of deep learning to biomedical image segmentation.  [U-Net](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597) is a relatively new architecture that combines convolutional neural networks and variational autoencoders to perform segmentation.   We are currently evaluating the efficacy of the U-Net model on a range of segmentation tasks for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data.
