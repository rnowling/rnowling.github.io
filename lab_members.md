Email: nowling@msoe.edu<br />[CV](/static/rnowling_resume.pdf)

I started as an Assistant Professor in the Electrical Engineering & Computer Science department of the [Milwaukee School of Engineering](https://www.msoe.edu) in August 2018.  From 2014 to 2018, I worked on scalable machine learning systems at [AdRoll](http://www.adroll.com/) and [Red Hat](http://www.redhat.com/). Before then, I received a Ph.D. in [Computer Science & Engineering](http://cse.nd.edu/) from the [University of Notre Dame](http://www.nd.edu) and a B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics from [Eckerd College](http://www.eckerd.edu).  My research over the last few years has employed statistics and machine learning to study the genomic data from insect vectors.

## **Current Students**

### Jarred K. (Summer 2021 - Present)
Jarred is evaluating ensemble techniques for handling imbalanced genomics data in classification problems.

### Daniel L. (Fall 2020 - Present)
Daniel worked on inversion detection using k-mer count features and is now exploring approaches for predicting TF-DNA motifs binding pairs.

### John P. (Winter 2019-2020, Winter 2021 - Present)
John worked in the lab during the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 Winter quarters.  In his first rotation, John explored and optimized the use of ensembles to reduce variance in predictions of enhancer activity from logistic regression models using k-mer count features.  John is working on integrating multi-omics data to identify and annotate putative functional components of enhancer sequences.

## **Alumni**

### Oliver B. (Winter 2018-2019)
Oliver was an exchange student from the [Czech Technical University in Prague](https://www.cvut.cz/en) studying at MSOE for the 2018-2019 school year.  Oliver was working on applying convolutional neural networks to detecting prostates in Magnetic Resonance (MR) images.

### Rafael R. G. (Fall - Spring 2019-2020)
Rafael graduated from the Computering Engineering program at MSOE in Spring 2020.  During the 2019-2020 academic year, Rafael applied machine learning to identifying and predicting enhancer properties of sequences.

### Ben H. (Winter and Spring 2019-2020)
Ben graduated from the Software Engineering program at MSOE in Spring 2020.  During the Winter and Spring of 2019-2020, Ben implemented and evaluated published CNN models on enhancer sequence prediction.

### Krystal M. (Spring 2019 - Spring 2020)
Krystal graduated from the [BioMolecular Engineering](https://www.msoe.edu/academics/undergraduate-degrees/engineering/biomolecular-engineering/) program at MSOE in 2019. Krystal worked in the lab from the Spring 2019 quarter through the end of the the summer of 2019. Krystal evaluated methods for detecting chromsomal inversions from SNPs and then implemented and ran a variant calling pipeline.  Krystal started a [M.S. in Bioinformatics](https://www.marquette.edu/grad/programs-bioinformatics.php) at [Marquette University](https://www.marquette.edu/) in Fall 2019.

### Errin M. (Fall and Winter 2020-2021)
Errin worked on characterizing enhancer sequences in the *Anopheles* genome.

### Andrew R. (Fall and Winter 2020-2021)
Andrew analyzed differences between FAIRE peaks for versions 3 and 5 of the *Aedes* genome.

### Matt A. (Summer 2019, Fall 2020 - Spring 2021)
Matt worked with me during the summer of 2019 and is back for the 2020-2021 academic year.  Matt is a junior in the [Computer Science](https://www.msoe.edu/academics/undergraduate-degrees/engineering/computer-science/) program at MSOE.  Matt previously implemented a population genetics simulator and explored how different processes of molecular evolution present in PCA of SNP data.  This year, Matt is working on automating parameter selection for the inversion detection using machine learning.
