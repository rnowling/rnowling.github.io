Email: nowling@msoe.edu<br />[CV](/static/rnowling_resume.pdf)

I started as an Assistant Professor in the Electrical Engineering & Computer Science department of the [Milwaukee School of Engineering](https://www.msoe.edu) in August 2018.  From 2014 to 2018, I worked on scalable machine learning systems at [AdRoll](http://www.adroll.com/) and [Red Hat](http://www.redhat.com/). Before then, I received a Ph.D. in [Computer Science & Engineering](http://cse.nd.edu/) from the [University of Notre Dame](http://www.nd.edu) and a B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics from [Eckerd College](http://www.eckerd.edu).  My research over the last few years has employed statistics and machine learning to study the population genetics of insect vectors.

## Current Students

### Matt A.
Matt worked with me during the summer of 2019 and is back for the 2020-2021 academic year.  Matt is a junior in the [Computer Science](https://www.msoe.edu/academics/undergraduate-degrees/engineering/computer-science/) program at MSOE.  Matt previously implemented a population genetics simulator and explored how different processes of molecular evolution present in PCA of SNP data.  This year, Matt is working on automating parameter selection for the inversion detection using machine learning.

### Daniel L.
Daniel is a sophomore in our Computer Science program.  Daniel is working on inversion detection using k-mer count features.

### Errin M.
Errin is a junior in our Computer Science program.  Errin and I are working with my collaborator to characterize enhancer sequences in the *Anopheles* genome.

### John P.
John worked in the lab during the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 Winter quarters.  In his first rotation, John explored and optimized the use of ensembles to reduce variance in predictions of enhancer activity from logistic regression models using k-mer count features.  John is now working on comparing *Drosophila* FAIRE peaks across developmental periods and tissues.

### Andrew R.
Andrew is a sophomore in our Computer Science program.  Andrew is analyzing differences between FAIRE peaks for versions 3 and 5 of the *Aedes* genome.

## Alumni

### Oliver B.
Oliver was an exchange student from the [Czech Technical University in Prague](https://www.cvut.cz/en) studying at MSOE for the 2018-2019 school year.  Oliver was working on applying convolutional neural networks to detecting prostates in Magnetic Resonance (MR) images.

### Rafael R. G.
Rafael graduated from the Computering Engineering program at MSOE in Spring 2020.  During the 2019-2020 academic year, Rafael applied machine learning to identifying and predicting enhancer properties of sequences.

### Ben H.
Ben graduated from the Software Engineering program at MSOE in Spring 2020.  During the Winter and Spring of 2019-2020, Ben implemented and evaluated published CNN models on enhancer sequence prediction.

### Sam K.
Sam joined the lab's weekly research office hours during the 2020-2021 academic year.

### Jessica K.
Sam joined the lab's weekly research office hours and meetings with one of my collaborators during the Fall 2020 quarter.

### Krystal M.
Krystal graduated from the [BioMolecular Engineering](https://www.msoe.edu/academics/undergraduate-degrees/engineering/biomolecular-engineering/) program at MSOE in 2019. Krystal worked in the lab from the Spring 2019 quarter through the end of the the summer of 2019. Krystal evaluated methods for detecting chromsomal inversions from SNPs and then implemented and ran a variant calling pipeline.  Krystal started a [M.S. in Bioinformatics](https://www.marquette.edu/grad/programs-bioinformatics.php) at [Marquette University](https://www.marquette.edu/) in Fall 2019.

### Kaitlyn R.
Kaitlyn joined the lab's weekly research office hours during the 2020-2021 academic year.  Kaitlyn read and presented papers, helping us to improve the breadth of our knowledge.
