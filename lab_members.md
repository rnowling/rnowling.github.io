Email: nowling@msoe.edu<br />[CV](/static/rnowling_resume.pdf)

I started as an Assistant Professor in the Electrical Engineering & Computer Science department of the [Milwaukee School of Engineering](https://www.msoe.edu) in August 2018.  From 2014 to 2018, I worked on scalable machine learning systems at [AdRoll](http://www.adroll.com/) and [Red Hat](http://www.redhat.com/). Before then, I received a Ph.D. in [Computer Science & Engineering](http://cse.nd.edu/) from the [University of Notre Dame](http://www.nd.edu) and a B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics from [Eckerd College](http://www.eckerd.edu).  My research over the last few years has employed statistics and machine learning to study the population genetics of insect vectors.



## Alumni

### Matthew Aleck

Matt worked with me during the summer of 2019.  Matt was a rising sophomore in the [Computer Science](https://www.msoe.edu/academics/undergraduate-degrees/engineering/computer-science/) program at MSOE.  Matt implemented a population genetics simulator and explored how different processes of molecular evolution present in PCA of SNP data.


### Oliver Blasko

Oliver was an exchange student from the [Czech Technical University in Prague](https://www.cvut.cz/en) studying at MSOE for the 2018-2019 school year.  Oliver was working on applying convolutional neural networks to detecting prostates in Magnetic Resonance (MR) images.

### Rafael Reple Geromel

Rafael graduated from the Computering Engineering program at MSOE in Spring 2020.  During the 2019-2020 academic year, Rafael applied machine learning to identifying and predicting enhancer properties of sequences.

### Ben Halligan

Ben graduated from the Software Engineering program at MSOE in Spring 2020.  During the Winter and Spring of 2019-2020, Ben implemented and evaluated published CNN models on enhancer sequence prediction.

### Krystal Manke

Krystal graduated from the [BioMolecular Engineering](https://www.msoe.edu/academics/undergraduate-degrees/engineering/biomolecular-engineering/) program at MSOE in 2019. Krystal worked in the lab from the Spring 2019 quarter through the end of the the summer of 2019. Krystal evaluated methods for detecting chromsomal inversions from SNPs and then implemented and ran a variant calling pipeline.  Krystal started a [M.S. in Bioinformatics](https://www.marquette.edu/grad/programs-bioinformatics.php) at [Marquette University](https://www.marquette.edu/) in Fall 2019.


### John Peters
John worked in the lab during the Winter 2019-2020 quarter.  John explored and optimized the use of ensembles to reduce variance in predictions of enhancer activity from logistic regression models using k-mer count features.
