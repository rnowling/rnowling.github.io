I've been involved in various research and open source projects.  I've made list here.

Big Data / Distributed Systems
------------------------------

Apache Spark
============
[Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) is a next generation distributed compute engine with a multimodal (data pipeline and SQL) programming model.  Spark is particularly well suited to data cleaning, processing, and analytics.

BigPetStore
===========
BigPetStore is an ecosystem of data generation and example applications focused on transaction data for a fictional chain of pet stores.  Most of BigPetStore's projects are hosted in [Apache BigTop](http://bigtop.apache.org/), of which I'm a committer.

Bioinformatics
--------------

Computational Physics
---------------------
I spent the first four years of my Ph.D. working on new models and numerical methods for molecular dynamics.
