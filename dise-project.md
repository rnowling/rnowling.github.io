## MSOE Data-Intensive Systems Education (DISE) Project
Machine learning systems are incredibly data hungry.  Data sets for production systems can easily exceed what can be
processed on a single machine.  Designing and implementing production systems that incorporate machine learning requires
knowledge of: data storage systems, scalable data processing software, machine learning, MLOps, microservices, cloud
computing, and algorithms and design patterns for batch and streaming analytics.  I developed a foundation of knowledge
spanning low-level system implementation through deployment and operation of systems with stringest reliability-
and performance-related service level agreements (SLAs) through my experience with high-performance computing (HPC) from my
Ph.D., full-time positions as a software and data science engineer from June 2014 to August 2018, and recent consulting work
as a developer advocate for [Memphis.dev](https://memphis.dev/).  I'm developing curricula and realistic
implementations of example systems for related courses in MSOE's new graduate programs in machine learning.
