"How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Quiz" -- Dr. Strangelove (paraphrased slightly)

As a new instructor, I've come to appreciate quizzes as one of the most powerful and versatile yet low-cost tools in my toolbox. From the perspective of an instructor, quizzes are quicker and easier to write and grade than full exams.  At the same time, weekly quizzes add up to enough total points to motivate students but each individual quiz is not worth so much that a single bad quiz grade will significantly hamper a student's overall grade.

Initially, I began giving my students weekly quizzes in my introductory classes to measure the effectiveness of my lectures.  I figured that having a tight feedback loop would enable me to quickly make any necessary changes.  I certainly realized this benefit but I found other benefits, including increased attendance in office hours, along the way that easily justified losing some lecture time each week.

For example, when I offered to bump my students' first quiz grade to 100% if they visited my office hours in the first two weeks of the term, a substantial fraction of first-year students took me up on the offer.  Once the ice was broken, many of the students continued to come to office hours regularly for help or just to socialize -- even after the semester was over.

Over the last year, I've found that quizzes can be used for all of the following:

1. **Feedback Tool for Me as a Lecturer:** As a new instructor, I'm still trying to identify best practices in the classroom or how best to present each topic.  Weekly quizzes give me a rapid and regular feedback.  If a majority of the class is struggling to understand a topic, this is apparent on the weekly quiz.  I can then review the material and adjust my approach going forward.
2. **Self-Evaluation Tool for Students:** First-year students are still developing self-evaluation skills.  Until they have developed these skills, students often think they better understand the material than they really do.  When the students take a quiz in a testing situation, the illusions fall away and the students leave with a more realistic evaluation.
3. **Encouraging Study Habits:** Many students struggle with the transition from high school classes to college classes with fewer contact hours and a greater need for self study.  When quizzes are given on a regular basis, students come to expect them and develop a study schedule around the quizzes.  By preparing for regular quizzes, students develop habits of studying on a regular basis that continue past the current class.
4. **Practice for Exams:** When I gave my students take-home practice exams, they used the exam as a list of topics to study but not to evaluate themselves.  Quizzes provide practice opportunities in realistic testing environments, so students get a better sense of their strengths and weaknesses. I found that giving my students quizzes with questions similar to what would be on the exam led to improved exam grades compared with only giving them take-home practice exams.
5. **Opportunity to Review Material:** After each quiz, I discuss the answers with the class. This gives me an opportunity to review the material, giving students a second look.  Further, since the questions are fresh in the students' minds, and the students have a better sense of what they do and don't understand, they tend to be more engaged than usual and pay close attention.
6. **Improve Office Hours Attendance:** Many of my students take me up on my offer to bump their first quiz grade to a 100% if they visit my office hours at the beginning of the term.  At the same time, a single quiz grade won't substantially impact the students' overall grades, so I don't feel that I'm inflating grades.  For many students, that first office hours visit turns into regular visits.  These regular visits means that I can help students early, before problems (academic or otherwise) fester and become insurmountable.
