For the last couple of years, I've been itching to build a substantial project in [Clojure](http://clojure.org/).  

Thanks to some new libraries, I think Clojure finally has the chance to compete on equal footing with Python.  Mike Anderson's [`core.matrix`](https://github.com/mikera/core.matrix) offers a compelling alternative to [`numpy`](http://www.numpy.org/) and [JFreeChart](http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/samples.html) should be sufficient for my purposes.  I'm most excited about [Rinu Boney](http://rinuboney.github.io/)'s new Clojure machine-learning library [`clatern`](https://github.com/rinuboney/clatern), which has the potential to be a decent alternative to [`scikit-learn`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) for most of my day-to-day work.

Building and maintaining an open-source project is hard work. Building a community around it is even harder. Since `clatern` scratches a real itch for me, I care about its success and decided to get involved.  Rinu has already done the initial hard work of implementing a handful of useful methods and outlining a vision for the project.

To be successful, however, a project also needs some polish so that's where I've been focusing my contributions.  A testing approach needs to be devised to help developers makes changes with confidence.  Contribution guidelines and common coding conventions need to be established.  And a project needs good documentation and clear examples to help users get started easily and quickly.  

Keep your eye on `clatern` -- I'm expecting to see some great things come out of this project.
